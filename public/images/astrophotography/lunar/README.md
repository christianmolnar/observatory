# Lunar Images

Place lunar images in this folder. Images should be named descriptively and have corresponding metadata entries in `/src/data/metadata.json`.

Example filenames:
- `Full-Moon-Dec-2024.jpg`
- `Lunar-Crater-Closeup.jpg`
- `Waxing-Gibbous-Moon.jpg`

Note: Lunar eclipses should be placed in the `/events` folder as they are now categorized under Celestial Events.

Images placed here will automatically appear in the Lunar gallery at `/astrophotography/solar-system/lunar`.
