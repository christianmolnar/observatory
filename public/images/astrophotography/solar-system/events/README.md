# Celestial Events Images

Place images of special celestial events in this folder. Images should be named descriptively and have corresponding metadata entries in `/src/data/metadata.json`.

Example filenames:
- `Lunar-Eclipse-2024.jpg`
- `Solar-Eclipse-Totality.jpg`
- `Jupiter-Saturn-Conjunction.jpg`
- `Venus-Transit.jpg`
- `Comet-Neowise.jpg`

This folder now includes eclipses (previously under Lunar) along with other rare astronomical events.

Images placed here will automatically appear in the Celestial Events gallery at `/astrophotography/solar-system/events`.
