# Image Sorting Implementation - Complete Solution

## Overview
**DESIGN-PROTECTED: Core image sorting system**
This document explains the complete solution for sorting gallery images by newest files first on specific "All" category pages only.

## Problem Solved
- Gallery images were not being sorted by actual file modification time
- User's recently modified "North America and The Pelican.jpg" was not appearing first in the gallery
- Previous solution relied on filename patterns instead of actual file timestamps

## Solution Architecture

### 1. File Timestamp Capture System
**File**: `scripts/capture-file-times.js`
- Scans all image files in `/public/images/` directory structure
- Captures actual file modification times using Node.js `fs.statSync()`
- Saves timestamp data to `src/data/file-timestamps.json`
- Runs automatically during build process

### 2. Build Integration
**File**: `package.json`
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "node scripts/capture-file-times.js && next build",
    "capture-timestamps": "node scripts/capture-file-times.js"
  }
}
```
- Timestamps are captured fresh on every build
- Ensures deployment has latest file modification data

### 3. Gallery Sorting Logic
**File**: `src/components/GalleryTemplate.tsx`
- Imports actual file timestamps from JSON data
- Applies sorting ONLY to specific "All" category pages:
  - All Deep Sky (`astrophotography/deep-sky`)
  - All Wide Field (`wide-field`)
  - All Solar System (`astrophotography/solar-system`)
  - All Terrestrial (`terrestrial`)

### 4. Path Resolution System
The sorting function handles complex path structures:
- **Deep Sky Images**: Located in subdirectories (`nebulas/`, `galaxies/`, `featured/`, `events/`)
- **Other Categories**: Direct folder structure
- **Fallback Logic**: Date extraction from filenames if timestamps unavailable

## Implementation Details

### Timestamp Data Structure
```json
{
  "astrophotography/deep-sky/nebulas/North America and The Pelican.jpg": {
    "mtime": "2025-07-30T21:12:58.691Z",
    "mtimeMs": 1753909978690.7815,
    "filename": "North America and The Pelican.jpg"
  }
}
```

### Sorting Algorithm
1. **Primary**: Actual file modification time (newest first)
2. **Secondary**: Date extracted from filename patterns
3. **Tertiary**: Reverse alphabetical order

### Path Matching Logic
For Deep Sky images, searches multiple potential paths:
- `astrophotography/deep-sky/nebulas/[filename]`
- `astrophotography/deep-sky/galaxies/[filename]`
- `astrophotography/deep-sky/featured/[filename]`
- `astrophotography/deep-sky/events/[filename]`

## Verification Results

### File Timestamp Confirmation
"North America and The Pelican.jpg" shows:
- **Modification Time**: July 30, 2025, 21:12:58 GMT
- **Timestamp**: 1753909978690.7815 ms
- **Location**: `astrophotography/deep-sky/nebulas/`

### Build Success
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Successful
- ESLint warnings: Minor performance suggestions only
- Static generation: ✅ All 24 pages generated
- File timestamps: ✅ 142 files captured

## User Impact
- Recently modified images now appear first in gallery listings
- Sorting is consistent and based on actual file modification times
- Non-gallery pages maintain original alphabetical sorting
- Build process automatically updates timestamps for deployment

## Maintenance
- **Automatic**: Timestamps update on every build
- **Manual**: Run `npm run capture-timestamps` to refresh timestamps
- **Protected**: Core sorting logic marked as DESIGN-PROTECTED

## Technical Notes
- Uses browser-compatible JSON import for timestamp data
- TypeScript-safe implementation with proper type definitions
- Minimal performance impact (timestamp lookup is O(1))
- Fallback mechanisms ensure robustness
