# Arizona Observatory - Executive Summary

**Mission:** Create a fully automated ASIAir-controlled observatory in Phoenix, Arizona, capable of unattended operation from sunset to sunrise.

**Approach:** Plan A (ASIAir ecosystem) with dual telescope setup plus wide-field DSLR capability.

---

## Current Status Assessment

### Equipment Ready for Automation ✓

- **ASIAir Plus Controller** - Perfect foundation for Plan A
- **2x ZWO EAF Focusers** - Native integration, temperature compensation  
- **Telescopes** - Meade 8" SCT + William Optics Zenithstar 81 (excellent pair)
- **Cameras** - ASI533MC, ASI676MC, ASI462MC (all ASIAir native)
- **Nikon D5300** - Wide-field capability, ASIAir DSLR support confirmed
- **Wide-Field Lenses** - Rokinon 14mm, Samyang 85mm/135mm (piggyback setup)

### Critical Upgrade Required

**Mount:** Meade LX75 → **ZWO AM5N** ($2,500)

- **Why Essential:** LX75 cannot achieve unattended operation
- **AM5N Benefits:** No manual alignment, 20kg capacity, native ASIAir integration

### Observatory Infrastructure Needed

- **Dome System:** $5,000-15,000 (NexDome → ScopeDome options)
- **Automation Software:** Integrated with dome choice
- **Phoenix Considerations:** Monsoon protection critical

## Simplified Approach Benefits

- **ASI2600MC** - Keep all color cameras, no monochrome complexity
- **Single Filter** - L-Ultimate dual-band, no filter wheel needed initially  
- **ASI462MC** - Keep current planetary camera, proven performer
- **Dual-Band Processing** - Near-Hubble palette without traditional narrowband setup

---

## Processing Capabilities

### Current Strengths with PixInsight

- **RGB Channel Separation** - Extract R/G/B from ASI2600MC for individual processing
- **Dual-Band Processing** - Use Optolong L-Ultimate for pseudo-Hubble palette
- **Wide-Field Excellence** - D5300 + lens collection for constellation work
- **Professional Workflows** - Advanced color grading and noise reduction

### Hubble Palette Options

1. **Current Setup** - Pseudo-Hubble using dual-band filter + channel extraction
2. **Future Upgrade** - True Hubble with ASI294MM Pro + narrowband filters ($2,150-2,700)

---

## Observatory Configuration

### Final Automated Setup

- **Mount** - ZWO AM5N (dual telescope platform)
- **Primary Telescope** - Zenithstar 81 + ASI533MC (wide-field deep sky)
- **Secondary Telescope** - 8" SCT + ASI676MC (narrow-field deep sky)
- **Guide System** - 50mm scope + ASI462MC (proven combination)
- **Wide-Field System** - Nikon D5300 piggyback on Zenithstar
- **Control** - Single ASIAir Plus controlling all systems
- **Dome** - Automated with weather integration

### Operational Workflow

1. **Sunset** - Dome opens automatically, systems power up
2. **Evening** - ASIAir Plan Mode executes imaging sequences  
3. **Night** - Unattended operation across multiple targets
4. **Dawn** - Automatic park and dome closure
5. **Processing** - PixInsight workflows for professional results
